# Task Queue Bot - Logger

The project now includes a simple logger utility at `utils/logger.js`.

Behavior:

  YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS - <discordId> : <message>


```js
const logger = require('./utils/logger');
logger.log({ id: interaction.user.id, username: interaction.user.username }, 'your message here');
```

Options:

Example messages are added in the command handlers: `commands/*` will now log user actions (addgroup, addtask, remove, move, rename, setreminderhours, status, sort, clearcompleted, backup, search, list, help).

If you want a different log directory or behavior (rotate files, external logger like winston), I can add that.
